# Cinder: build, host, and sell AI-powered microservices on Web3

This is the repository for the Cinder LLM interaction framework. 

Cinder is an open-source tool designed to allow anyone to start building specialized AI-powered microservices in minutes. The framework supports lazy Web3 integration to enable the sale of access to specialized Cinder assistants in zero-trust environments. 

Cinder assistants are designed to be containerized and instantiated in a collaborative and decentralized network using AI-powered abstract computing. This means that developers using the framework can cooperate to build AI-enabled services without risking the collection of their intellectual property by unauthorized parties.

The Cinder framework is currently in public preview, and not intended for production environments.
